# Source Cooperative Viewers

The Source Cooperative Viewers is a library of interactive data viewers for data served through HTTP.
These viewers power the dataset browser on Source Cooperative but can operate independtly from Source Cooperative.

## Project Goals

The goal for this project is to enable large datasets to be explored through a browser.
By focusing on supporting cloud-native data formats we can enable the exploration of these datasets without having to download the entire dataset.

## Demo

Viewers can be explored and interacted with at [https://viewers.source.coop](https://viewers.source.coop).
These viewers currently support any file served through HTTP.

## Current Viewers

- Markdown
- Text File
- PMTiles
- GeoJSON
